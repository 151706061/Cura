=Normal mode=
Normal mode is the mode most people will use. It gives access to all the settings and will allow for the best adjustments for your prints.

There are 3 locations that contain settings. The first is the '''Print Config''' tab, which contains the most important settings. These are the settings you most likely want to adjust to your liking.

Then there are the '''Advanced Config''', this contains more advanced settings, which you usually only adjust once or twice to your liking.

Finally there are '''Expert config''' settings which can be found in the menu. These are settings that you usually don't need to adjust. But to get the most out of your printer you might want to change these. Experimental settings can also be found here.
